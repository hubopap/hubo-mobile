Our project consists of a platform, a Web App and a mobile App developed using several tools, such as: JavaScript and the Next.js framework as the basis of the Web App and React native for the mobile app. The project we developed allows us to solve a common problem nowadays, the poor organization of work groups. Our platform is used as a workgroup manager, where the user can create numerous groups, add users and assign tasks to them, and share files between group members. Both applications are compatible (same API) and have a simple and elegant interface. We created this project in the ambit of the professional aptitude test of our course, we admit that it may not be 100% correct but it is 100% functional :D we used AI to make some functions.
